**STRIDE Threat Modeling Analysis**

| **Threat Category** | **Potential Vulnerability in Flask App** | **Example Scenario** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Spoofing** | Lack of robust authentication mechanisms for sensitive endpoints. | An attacker impersonates a legitimate user to access restricted functionalities. |
| **Tampering** | Insufficient input validation leading to command injection. | Malicious input alters the behavior of system commands, such as the ping functionality. |
| **Repudiation** | Absence of detailed logging for user actions. | A user denies performing a specific action, and there's no audit trail to confirm or refute the claim. |
| **Information Disclosure** | Exposure of sensitive information through error messages or misconfigured endpoints. | Detailed error messages reveal stack traces or system information to unauthorized users. |
| **Denial of Service** | Unrestricted resource usage leading to potential service disruption. | An attacker sends numerous requests to the /calculate endpoint, exhausting system resources. |
| **Elevation of Privilege** | Running the application with elevated permissions inside the container. | A vulnerability allows an attacker to gain higher privileges within the container environment. |
